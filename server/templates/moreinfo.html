    These can be whole authors, whole works, parts of works, whole classes of authors, and whole classes of work.</p>

    <p class="explanation">For example: adding the author <span class="emph">Plato</span> and the class <span class="emph">Tragici</span>, you could compare Plato and tragedians.
    Similarly the author <span class="emph">Plato</span> and the work genre <span class="emph">Satyr.</span> would let you compare Plato and satyr plays.
    Likewise the work <span class="emph">Thucydides, <span class="italic">Historiae</span></span> could be combined with <span class="emph">Herodotus, <span class="italic">Historiae</span></span>.
    This could be further refined down to <span class="emph">Thucydides, <span class="italic">Historiae</span> Book 1</span> and <span class="emph">Herodotus, <span class="italic">Historiae</span> Book 1</span>.
    In fact absurd levels of specificity can be chosen: <span class="emph">Thucydides , <span class="italic">Historiae</span> Book 1, chapter 114, section 2, line 2</span> is a perfectly valid selection.

    <span class="label">Add an item to the exclusion list</span><br />
    <p class="explanation">Use the information in the box or boxes to the left of this button to append an item to the list of things one is not going to search for.
    These can be whole authors, whole works, parts of works, whole classes of authors, and whole classes of work.</p>
    <p class="explanation">For example: adding the author <span class="emph">Plato</span> and the class <span class="emph">Tragici</span> to the exclusion list, you could search for the use of a term outside of Plato and Tragedy.
    Mixing inclusions and exclusions can produce interesting possibilities: the author <span class="emph">Plutarch</span> as a selection and the work genre <span class="emph">Biogr.</span> as an exclusion yields all of Plutarch but for the <span class="italic">Lives</span>.
    Similarly adding <span class="emph">Homer</span> and <span class="emph">Epici</span> and excluding <span class="emph"><span class="italic">Ilias</span></span> and then setting the time restriction to 850BCE to 500 CE will give you non-Iliadic early epic. Consider tossing in some <span class="emph">Hymn.</span> for good measure...
    It is also possible to search something like <span class="emph">Herodotus, <span class="italic">Histories</span></span> less books 1 and 2 by adding the former to the selection list and the latter to the exclusion list.
    But excluding a subsection within a section is not supported: Book 1 less section 1 has not been implemented and probably never will be.

    <span class="label">Check the contents of your current search list</span></p>
    <p class="explanation">If you searched now for <span class="emph">Tragici</span> what text would you in fact search? Click on the <span class="emph">info</span> button to find out.
    This should give you a list of <span class="emph">works</span> that have all of the inclusions and exclusions currently in effect.
    </p>

    <fieldset><legend>Earliest date to search</legend><input type="text" value="-850" width="25px;"></fieldset>
    <fieldset><legend>Latest date to search</legend><input  type="text" value="1500" width="25px;"></fieldset>
    <p class="explanation">Choose a chronological span within which to limit the search. Note that the dates assigned to authors are very approximate
    and derived from original data that can look like <span class="emph">i-iii A.D.</span>. Such an author would be assigned to <span class="emph">200 C.E.</span>. <span class="emph">iv B.C</span> becomes <span class="emph">350 BCE</span>. A variety of quirks in the
    original data has become a variety of quirks here. Similarly many authors have no date at all and some works
    have a variety of dates because they are composite. Works such as these are assigned to <span class="emph">1500 C.E.</span>, even if that is ridiculous. That number should be considered
    equivalent to <span class="emph">unknown</span>. Check your search lists (<span class="ui-button-icon ui-icon ui-icon-info" title="Show/hide details of the current search list">&nbsp;</span>)
    to make sure you are getting what you want. Searching within a date range that is smaller than one century is likely to yield some measure of disappointment.
    Users are quite free to update authors with their own superior dates, but that requires learning SQL.<br />

    Note that there is a conflict between time as an exclusion principle and the selection list. Which should take priority? This question has been resolved as follows: individual selections
    trump generic chronological exclusions. And so:
    <ul class="forexample">
        <li>zero selections + no date restriction (-850 to 1500): search the <span class="emph">whole corpus</span></li>
        <li>zero selections + a date restriction: search for everybody within that date range; e.g., <span class="emph">5th century BCE Greek authors</span></li>
        <li>zero selections + a class or classes + a date restriction: search for all members of the class(es) within that date range; e.g. <span class="emph">epic before 1 C.E.</span></li>
        <li>an author/work/passage + a class or classes + a date restriction: search for the specific item(s) and search for all members of the class(es) within that date range;
            e.g. <span class="emph">Plutarch's <span class="italic">Solon</span></span> and <span class="emph">4th century BCE Greek orators</span></li>
    </ul>

<div id="RegexSearching">

Regex is a dark art unto itself. Consult the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/functions-matching.html">manual directly</a>.
<br /><br />
The more salient things to know/use:
<ul>
<li><code>[abc]</code> brackets a set of acceptable characters to look for in the next position: a, or b, or c. <code>lauda[st]</code> will find laudas or laudat but not laudare. </li>
<li><code>[^abc]</code> brackets a set of characters to exclude in the next position: not a, nor b, nor c. <code>lauda[^t]</code> is a search that refuses to find laudat, but it will find laudant.</li>
<li><code>(a|b|abc)</code> brackets a set of strings to look for: a, or b, or abc. <code>laud(o|as|at)</code> is a search for the present singular indicative forms of laudare. It will also find conlaudat. Note how you could use <code>co(n|l)laud</code> to make sure you got alternate spellings of conlaudare.</li>
<li><code>.</code> any character: <code>laud.nt</code> will find laudant, laudent, and, theoretically, laudZnt</li>
<li><code>\s</code> whitespace: \ssed\setiam\s is a search for ' sed etiam '. Please use the 'within 1 word' function instead of /s unless you know why you are not doing so.
</ul>
<br />
Here are some examples that give you an idea of the sort of things that are possible:<br /><br />
<code>\s\w\w\s\w\w\s\w\w\s\w\w\s</code> will find all runs of four words of two letters each.<br />
<code>\snon solum\s(\w*?)\ssed etiam</code> will find all places where <span class="lat">non solum... sed etiam...</span> bracket just a single word.
<br />
Unfortunately a lot of swanky heavy duty regex searches do not make sense: the DB is organized as a collection of 'lines', and the sort of multi-line searching
via regex that one might do in a flat text file will fail.

    The original data was not really designed to be aggregated. It was also not meant to be sliced up after this fashion.
    Various oddities and peculiarities ensue.

    <p><span class="label">Missing in action</span></p>
    <ul class="forexample">

        </li>
        <li>The Greek authors data is missing:
            <ul>
                <li>[nothing]</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The papyrus data is missing:
            <ul>
                <li>Author Genres</li>
                <li>Author Locations</li>
                <li>Work Genres</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The inscriptions data (I & II) is missing:
            <ul>
                <li>Author Genres</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="label">Internal heterogeneity</span></p>
        <ul class="forexample">Dates
        <li>The dates recorded with the Greek authors are not of the same sort as those recorded with the papyri and inscriptions.
            The Greek authors data is derived from LSJ and it originally looks like <span class="emph">'A.D. 2–3?'</span>. Some
            items are listed as <span class="emph">'Varia'</span> or <span class="emph">'Incerta'</span>.

            In short, these dates are approximate and inexact.
            Everything gets converted to the center of any available century or range of centuries.
            All questions are ignored.

            <ul>
                <li>4 BC ==> 350 BCE</li>
                <li>A.D. 2–3? ==> 200 CE</li>
            </ul>

            The net result is that it is very easy to exclude authors by being over-refined in your search. The margin of error is huge.

        </li>
        <li>
            The dates recorded with the papyri and the inscriptions vary from '?' to something very precise like 212 CE. Hipparchia has
            parsed the dates that the editors have assigned to these items as best as it can. Please note that there are
            21584 distinct recorded_date values in the works table. Some of these are in German, some use Roman numerals, some use 'a' and 'p',
            some 'BC' and 'AD', some ordinal numbers, some cardinal numbers. Some are 'the age of X'. It's not easy to get all of these right
            (even if the editorial date is itself accurate...). It is not even easy to check that they are right.
            As above, all questions are dropped and all spans are turned into a single number representing the midpoint.
            'Ages' have had dates assigned to them. Claudius will be the middle of the reign, approximately: 50 CE.
            'Byzantine' is a bit trickier... 700 CE has been chosen for lack of some other solution.
            Rough/round numbers have been chosen where something specific is not available. Avoid over-refined searches
            unless you know that you do not care about items that have not been dated with some precision.

        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="forexample">Author Locations
            <li>
                The locations recorded with the Greek authors are not of the same sort as those recorded with the papyri and inscriptions.
                The Greek authors data is derived from LSJ and it originally looks like <span class="emph">'Athenae'</span>,
                <span class="emph">'Ilium [vel Troja]'</span>, and <span class="emph">'Sinope'</span>. Many authors have no location
                recorded. Be careful not to throw out more authors than you mean to by putting too much confidence in this data.
            </li>
            <li>
                The locations for inscription 'authors' is inferential. If the name of the corpus contains something that
                looks like a location, it has been grabbed: 'Attica' for example. Note that 'Attica' is not 'Athenae': you would need
                to ask for both locations to get IG's Attica + LSJ's Attic authors. Some sets of inscriptions come from more than one
                place: 'Cos and Calymna', for example, and not just 'Cos'
                Furthermore many corpora do not have any (pseudo-)locations that can be inferred from their name: for example,
                'Late Antique Latin' is not a place, at least not a literal one.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="forexample">Work Locations
            <li>
                There are 14001 distinct locations on offer. That's a painfully large number. It is not at all easy to
                pare these down in an automated fashion. 110 start with 'Alex'. Some of these could be folded into one
                another, but the data has many shapes, and no decision has been reached yet about where/how to make the unkind cuts.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="forexample">Missing characters and display quirks
            <li>
                There are various unprintable characters in the original data. These fall under various headings
            </li>
                <ul class="numbered">
                    <li>
                        Idiosyncratic characters that have no unicode representation. You will see ◦ in the text. If you look at
                        the database and/or HTML output you will see a code number: 'hmu_idiosyncratic_char value="1122"', e.g.
                        This can be decoded via the Betacode manual.
                        It is possible to know what was in the text, but it is not possible to display it, at least not yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Undocumented characters are all rendered as ⊚. If you look at
                        the database and/or HTML output you will see a code number: hmu_undocumented_poundsign value="1069", e.g.
                        The original data has either been misparsed or it yielded a value that is not present in the Betacode manual.
                        Further documentation ought to make it possible to put the proper character in here.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some characters will not display becuase they have been properly encoded but they are missing from your fonts.
                        They will display properly if/when you get a font that supports them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>
                Formatting instructions have typically been followed: make the font bigger, superscript, cross out... But not
                all of the codes found have been documented. And some are too painful to implement: start multi-column display,
                reverse text direction, writing perpendicular to main text, ... Probing the database will usually let you know what was found.
                But it is up to you to implement the proper method of displaying this material.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brackets that converge with HTML or other markup have typically been replaced with a near equivalent: &lt;
                signals markup instructions to a page renderer. Left and right angled bracket were swapped out. They are present in the database with
                other characters instead: ⟪ and ⟫. A similar logic governed the choice of ⦅ and ⦆ since ( and ) are special
                characters in betacode. There are other (hopefully) inconsequential items that fall under this heading.
