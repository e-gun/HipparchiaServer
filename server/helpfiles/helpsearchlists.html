    <span class="label">Add an item to the search list</span><br />
    <p class="explanation">Use the information in the box or boxes to the left of this button to append an item to the list of things one is searching for.
    These can be whole authors, whole works, parts of works, whole classes of authors, and whole classes of work.</p>

    <p class="explanation">For example: adding the author <span class="emph">Plato</span> and the class <span class="emph">Tragici</span>, you could compare Plato and tragedians.
    Similarly the author <span class="emph">Plato</span> and the work genre <span class="emph">Satyr.</span> would let you compare Plato and satyr plays.
    Likewise the work <span class="emph">Thucydides, <span class="italic">Historiae</span></span> could be combined with <span class="emph">Herodotus, <span class="italic">Historiae</span></span>.
    This could be further refined down to <span class="emph">Thucydides, <span class="italic">Historiae</span> Book 1</span> and <span class="emph">Herodotus, <span class="italic">Historiae</span> Book 1</span>.
    In fact absurd levels of specificity can be chosen: <span class="emph">Thucydides , <span class="italic">Historiae</span> Book 1, chapter 114, section 2, line 2</span> is a perfectly valid selection.

<button class="ui-button ui-corner-all ui-widget ui-button-icon-only" title="Exclude this category and/or genre">

    <span class="label">Add an item to the exclusion list</span><br />
    <p class="explanation">Use the information in the box or boxes to the left of this button to append an item to the list of things one is not going to search for.
    These can be whole authors, whole works, parts of works, whole classes of authors, and whole classes of work.</p>
    <p class="explanation">For example: adding the author <span class="emph">Plato</span> and the class <span class="emph">Tragici</span> to the exclusion list, you could search for the use of a term outside of Plato and Tragedy.
    Mixing inclusions and exclusions can produce interesting possibilities: the author <span class="emph">Plutarch</span> as a selection and the work genre <span class="emph">Biogr.</span> as an exclusion yields all of Plutarch but for the <span class="italic">Lives</span>.
    Similarly adding <span class="emph">Homer</span> and <span class="emph">Epici</span> and excluding <span class="emph"><span class="italic">Ilias</span></span> and then setting the time restriction to 850BCE to 500 CE will give you non-Iliadic early epic. Consider tossing in some <span class="emph">Hymn.</span> for good measure...
    It is also possible to search something like <span class="emph">Herodotus, <span class="italic">Histories</span></span> less books 1 and 2 by adding the former to the selection list and the latter to the exclusion list.
    But excluding a subsection within a section is not supported: Book 1 less section 1 has not been implemented and probably never will be.

    <p class="explanation">If you searched now for <span class="emph">Tragici</span> what text would you in fact search? Click on the <span class="emph">info</span> button to find out.
    This should give you a list of <span class="emph">works</span> that reflect all of the inclusions and exclusions currently in effect.

    <p class="explanation">Choose a chronological span within which to limit the search. Note that the dates assigned to authors are very approximate
    and derived from original data that can look like <code>i-iii A.D.</code>. Such an author would be assigned to <code>200 CE</code>.
    Similarly <code>iv B.C</code> becomes <code>350 BCE</code>. A variety of quirks in the
    original data has become a variety of quirks here. Similarly many authors have no date at all and some works
        have a variety of dates because they are composite.
        Check your search lists (<span class="ui-button-icon ui-icon ui-icon-info" title="Show/hide details of the current search list">&nbsp;</span>)
    to make sure you are getting what you want. Searching within a date range that is smaller than one century is likely to yield some measure of disappointment.
    Users are quite free to update authors with their own superior dates, but that requires learning SQL. Please consider sharing with others any/all improvements that you make to the original data.<br />
    <br />
    Note that there is a conflict between time as an exclusion principle and the selection list. Which should take priority? This question has been resolved as follows:
        <span class="emph">specific selections take priority over more general chronological exclusions</span>. And so:
    <ul class="forexample">
        <li>zero selections + no date restriction (-850 to 1500): search <span class="emph">all active corpora</span></li>
        <li>zero selections + a date restriction: search for everybody within that date range; e.g., <span class="emph">5th century BCE Greek authors</span> (if this is your only active corpus)</li>
        <li>zero selections + a class or classes + a date restriction: search for all members of the class(es) within that date range; e.g. <span class="emph">epic before 1 C.E.</span></li>
        <li>an author/work/passage + a class or classes + a date restriction: search for the specific item(s) and search for all members of the class(es) within that date range;
            e.g. <span class="emph">Plutarch's <span class="italic">Solon</span></span> and <span class="emph">4th century BCE Greek orators</span></li>
    </ul>

<p><span class="label">Removing items from lists</span></p>
    <p class="explanation"><span class="emph">Double-click</span> items from the include/exclude list and they will
        disappear from your list of selections or exclusions.
