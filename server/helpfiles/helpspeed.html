Search times will vary widely. If things seem unbearably slow, you should consider
changing your queries and/or the restrictions placed upon them. <span class="emph">Everything hinges on what you ask for</span>.
Slowdowns usually obey an exponential logic: things get 2x worse, then 4x worse, then...
This means that little shifts in your search can lead to huge improvements.
<br />
<br />
As noted below, hardware is a factor, but since you are unlikely to change your hardware much, let's start by spending some
time looking at the software side of things. But if your searches are about <span class="emph">50-75x slower</span> than these examples, you should
read about hardware.

<ul class="forexample">
    <li>
        Search <span class="emph">result formatting</span> can be a significant element of the speed of a search.
        The raw hits arrive in a first
        pass through the database. The context is derived by revisiting those same segments of the data. For example, the
        1,173 passages with ἐρχόμενοϲ in them
        can be found and displayed in <span class="colorhighlight">2.41s</span> if you set "Lines of context to accompany search results" to zero. If you
        want to see six lines of context, then be prepared to wait for <span class="colorhighlight">13.84s</span>.
        If you just want to skim a lot of results quickly, then <span class="emph">zero context</span> is a good way to go.
    </li>
    <li>Consider the following <span class="emph">simple searches</span>. Both searches are across all five databases. There are no restrictions applied at all.
    <ul class="numbered">
        <li><span class="sampleoutput">Sought »προκατέλαβον«; Searched 236840 texts and found 22 passages (<span class="colorhighlight">2.75s</span>)</span></li>
        <li><span class="sampleoutput">Sought »δεδιότεϲ«; Searched 236840 texts and found 589 passages (<span class="colorhighlight">5.41s</span>)</span></li>
    </ul>
    The first search is quite fast: a long word and an uncommon word.
    The second search is really about the same speed: most of the extra time was spent on formatting the 589 results not on
    generating the hits themselves. <span class="emph">Unrestricted searches for individual words will always be fastest</span>.
    Common words will slow things down somewhat, but the slowdown is trivial relative to the amount of time it will take
    you to sift through 1000+ results.
</li>
<li>
    Phrase searches are sent to one of two functions. If you pick a rare (accented) word, then that word will be searched.
    Then its environs will be searched. Otherwise PostgreSQL will build a nested query to look at windows of text that
    may or may not contain your phrase. <span class="emph">Most phrase searches will take roughly the same amount of time</span>
    since this 'windowing' is itself where most of the expensive computation happens.
    <ul class="numbered">
        <li><span class="sampleoutput">Sought »μεγάλην δύναμιν«; Searched 6625 texts and found 85 passages (<span class="colorhighlight">13.18s</span>)</span> (only Greek literary authors active)</li>
        <li><span class="sampleoutput">Sought »μεγάλην δύναμιν«; Searched 3008 texts and found 32 passages (<span class="colorhighlight">3.71s</span>); Searched between 850 B.C.E. and 1 C.E.</span></li>
        <li><span class="sampleoutput">Sought »τῷ φίλῳ μου«; Searched 236,845 texts and found 6 passages (<span class="colorhighlight">15.95s</span>)</span> (all databases active)</li>
        <li><span class="sampleoutput">Sought »οὐ μὴν ἀλλ«; Searched 236,845 texts and found 2,346 passages (<span class="colorhighlight">29.54s</span>)</span></li>
        <li><span class="sampleoutput">Sought »ἀνέθηκεν ὑπὲρ«; Searched 134,806 texts and found 19 passages (<span class="colorhighlight">8.93s</span>); Searched between 850 B.C.E. and 1 C.E.
    </ul>
As above, a common word sought across the whole corpus will slow you down.
Most phrase searches are likely to contain common words. So you should consider strategies to make the haystack smaller
unless you have some time to spare. It is totally safe to try to double-check Dennison on οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ, but you should
throw some restrictions in there to avoid a long search (that yields more results than you want anyway). Waiting 30s for 2400 results
is perhaps less of a problem than having 2400 results to read after the search completes.

<span class="emph">Hardware also matters</span>: προκατέλαβον (the first example above)
takes 2.75s with 5 workers on macOS 10.11 with a SSD and an 8 core CPU running at 3.5GHz.
With one worker the search executes in 11.32s. The search takes 4.85 seconds on a mac mini with a SSD and 2 cores running at 2.6GHz. But then
the search will take
23.4s when executed inside a virtual machine running on the same higher-end computer,
a virtual machine that has been assigned 4 cores and is running FreeBSD 11.
The κεκωλυκατε example yields a difference between 0.97s unemulated and 12.79s when inside a virtual machine. In short, emulation is costly. And
the main culprit is the emulated filesystem. Just see what happens if you pick ZFS instead of UFS...
A single word inside of just "Greek authors" takes 154s on a low end machine with a very slow 5400rpm 2.5" laptop
drive.
The processor load remains very low throughout the search: the culprit is the cheap hard drive. The same word can be found in 2.16s on the speedier machine:
Hipparchia is <span class="emph">50x-75x faster</span> with a faster drive.
A solid state drive makes a huge difference here (and just about everywhere else in your computing life). Consider investing in one.
In sum, fast drives and then more CPUs and then faster CPUs would be the order in which to seek to make speed gains.
<span class="emph">Access time to the data and not processing time of the data is far and away the most important factor.</span>
Get Hipparchia's DB onto a solid state drive if at all possible. After a certain threshold a faster CPU will end up just doing more waiting
for data to reach it. 2 or 3 workers on a moderately powerful machine with a fast drive is 85% as fast as a high end machine that in theory
can do 600% more work per second.
