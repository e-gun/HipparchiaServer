The dictionary data is connected to a parser table. This enables you to <span class="emph">click on a word</span> in the text browser and to (ideally) get a
morphological analysis as well as a definition. See also <span class="emph">Peculiarities and Gotchas</span> for more about the force of "ideally"
in the previous sentence.
<br />
The window that pops up will contain:
<ul class="numbered">
    <li>a line with a count of <span class="emph">all occurrences of this form</span> in the available data. For example <code>ὑμᾶϲ</code> yields:
        <ul class="roman">
            <li>Prevalence (this form): Ⓖ 22,231 / Ⓛ 1 / Ⓘ 361 / Ⓓ 985 / Ⓒ 39 / Ⓣ 23,617</li>
            <li>each circled letter corresponds to a database:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ⓖreek</li>
                    <li>Ⓛatin</li>
                    <li>Ⓘnscriptions I</li>
                    <li>Ⓓocumentary Papyri</li>
                    <li>(Ⓒhristian Era) Inscriptions II</li>
                    <li>There is also a Ⓣotal</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        NB: some texts (and their attendant vocabulary) appear more than once in the data.
        This is not just an issue of later authors quoting earlier ones.
        Plato Comicus is present both in all of the authors who quote him and as an author in his own right.
        Similarly the same inscription might be in two different editions that are both part present in the corpus.
        Accordingly <span class="emph">the word counts are slightly skewed</span> since something
        that really only occurs once can be found twice if you go through all of the data available.
    <li>then you will see a list of <span class="emph">parsing analyses</span> for this form
        <ul>
            <li>(1) ὑμᾶϲ (from ϲύ, thou): acc 2nd pl </li>
            <li>(2) ὑμᾶϲ (from ὑμόϲ, your): fem gen sg (epic doric aeolic) </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>next you will see the start of the dictionary entry to the first matching headword</li>
    <li>after this you see a second set of <span class="emph">prevalence data</span>. This time the numbers reflect
        <span class="emph">all occurrences of all (known) forms</span> of the word.
        The results for <code>εἰμι</code> are a composite of the results for
        <span class="emph">413</span> individual forms:
        <code>... 'ἔϲται', 'ἔϲτε', 'ἔϲτι', 'ἔϲτιν', 'ἔϲτον', 'ἔϲτω' ...</code>. NB: <span class="emph">homonyms</span>
        will get swept up in this net.
        That means that "to eat" will be marked as a very prevalent verb because "he/she/it eats" (<code>est</code>)
        is an astoundingly common verb form.
        Meanwhile there are words are in the database that are not <span class="emph">'known' forms</span> of a
        headword even though a clever person will be able to parse them: <code> ⒣εκατόν</code> and <code>ϲιδε̄ραῖ</code>,
        for example. The latter word might not even display properly because it violates 'the rules'.
        See <span class="italic">Peculiarities and Gotchas</span> for more about this issue.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="emph">weighted chronological distribution</span> combines a series of assumptions and calculations.
        <ul class="roman">
            <li>All forms of all words are sorted into three eras. <span class="emph">Early</span> or ⓔ is 850BCE to 300BCE.
                <span class="emph">Middle</span> or ⓜ is 299BCE to 300CE. <span class="emph">Late</span> or ⓛ is 301CE to 1500CE.</li>
            <li>Words that have no date associated with them are ignored. Moreover as <span class="emph">Peculiarities and Gotchas</span> will tell you,
                <span class="emph">"The margin of error is at least 50 years."</span></li>
            <li>After the results for all forms of each word have been sifted into three chronological piles a
                <span class="emph">weight</span> is applied to this number.</li>
            <li>This wieght is derived from the fact that there are roughly 1/8 as many words preserved from the early
                period as there are from the late period. Similarly there are about 1/2 as many words in the middle era
                as there are in the late era. Accordingly, <span class="emph">100 early hits have the weight of about 800 late hits</span> when
                it comes time to decide if the word is, relatively speaking, more of an 'early' word than a 'late' word.
            </li>
            <li>The final weighting score normalizes all three numbers to make them comparable to one another. Then
            <span class="emph">the maximum of the three is given a value of 100</span>. Then the other two are represented in relation to that 100.</li>
            <li><code>τύμμα</code> yields: ⓜ 100  / ⓔ 37 / ⓛ 35. This means that, relative to the middle period, the early and late periods are only
                about 1/3 as likely to use the word. And so one would plausibly describe it as more typical of that era than of the others. </li>
            <li>No account is taken of which words exist in later periods only via quotations of earlier periods. </li>
            <li>These figures are meant to give you general ideas about further queries, not to be some sort of final word. The results are
                quite accurate, but there are a number of quirks in the data from which they are derived that you would need to appreciate before
                making a categorical statement on the basis of these figures.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="emph">Weighted distribution by corpus</span> is calculated according to the same logic as the weight is applied to the chronological
        distribution of words. The <span class="emph">radical disparity in the size of the various corpora</span> can distort
        the results if a rare word appears in a small corpus.
        <ul class="roman">
            <li>Ⓖ is the largest with 98,957,805 words.</li>
            <li>Compared to Ⓖ, Ⓛ is only about 1/11 as large, Ⓘ is 1/28th as large, Ⓓ is 1/28th as large, and Ⓒ is 1/130th as large.
            Furthermore Ⓒ is strongly bilingual, so this further distorts the weight of an individual word in it as against
                some other largely monolingual corpus.</li>
            <li>The final weighting score normalizes all five numbers to make them comparable to one another. Then
                <span class="emph">the maximum of the five is given a value of 100</span>. </li>
            <li>Many words are strongly associated with one corpus or another. And in that sense one can say that they are
            more 'literary' or 'civic' or 'legal' or 'religious' depending on the pattern.</li>
            <ul class="forexample">
                <li><code>ψήφιϲμα</code> yields: Ⓘ 100 / Ⓖ 2 / Ⓒ 1 / Ⓓ 1 / Ⓛ 0. Even though there are over 2100 examples in the Greek
                    literary corpus, there are 4000 examples among the inscriptions. And <span class="emph">each of those 4000 'weighs' 28x as much</span> as
                each of the 2100. Accordingly the word, though quite common in the Greek corpus comes across looking like it might
                be somehow rare. Well, it is, at least when compared to its ubiquity in the inscriptions.</li>
                <li><code>οἶδα</code> yields: Ⓓ 100 / Ⓖ 85 / Ⓘ 25 / Ⓒ 11 / Ⓛ 0. This probably tells you something about the documentary papyri.</li>
                <li>It comes as little surprise that <code>δυϲτυχήϲ</code> is weighted towards the literary authors: Ⓖ 100 / Ⓒ 25 / Ⓘ 13 / Ⓓ 2 / Ⓛ 0.
                    If you search for it among the inscriptions the results will generally be gravestones.</li>
                <li><code>requies</code> is so common in epitaphs that this drowns out the Latin literary uses:  Ⓒ 100 / Ⓛ 6 / Ⓓ 0 / Ⓘ 0 / Ⓖ 0.</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>
    <li>
        <span class="emph">Weighted distribution by genre</span> is calculated as are its kindred categories above. There are a few of twists.
        The TLG assigned (almost every) work to one of 75(!) genres. 15 of these genres were 'theological'. And several were 'rhetorical'.
        The default is to aggregate 'Acta', 'Apocalyp.', 'Apol.', etc. under the heading <span class="emph">allrel</span>. Similarly 'Encom.' and 'Invect.' become
        part of <span class="emph">allrhet</span>. But you can turn this behavior off in <code>config.py</code>. The LAT data was not assigned to genres.
        It has been forced into the TLG genres with one addition: 'Agric.'. But often the fit is not all that tidy. And some works
        should probably be shifted.
        Words are distributed among genres differently in Latin and Greek: for example, "History" dominates the one and "Commentary" the other.
        And there is no "Agric." in the Greek corpus, but these comprise a major set of writings in the Latin corpus. 'Jurisprud.'
        is proportionally a much more significant body of writing in Latin than it is in Greek.
        So there are two sets of weighting scores, one for each language.
        Many genres have a small number of words in them. This is especially true for the LAT data in that the only
        words for a given genre are often Latin editorial notes in a Greek text. One match will have a totally unrealistic weight score. A 'vel sim.'
        inserted into a greek meterorological text would make it seem like 'vel' is an incredibly important word for
        meteorologists if you allow 'meterolog' to have a weight of 21714.12 relative to 'hist' owing to the disparity in size
        between the corpora: huge vs. basically non-existant (since no Latin works are actually tagged as meteorological).
        The default is to suppress genre weighting for any genre that is <1/500th the size of the top genre.
        The most represented genres are compared to one another in descending order.
        <ul class="forexample">
            <li><code>παράδειϲοϲ</code> yields: docu (100) / hymn (85) / orac (30) / narrfict (24) / hexametr (23)</li>
            <li><code>κατεϲθίω</code> yields: fab (100) / comic (44) / paradox (29) / polyhist (28) / myth (20)</li>
            <li><code>contio</code> yields: hist (100) / allrhet (79) / biogr (75) / polyhist (69) / tact (56)</li>
            <li><code>letifer</code> yields: epic (100) / lyr (30) / hexametr (23) / astron (20) / poem (17)</li>
        </ul>
        And so one can say that you are about 4x as likely to see παράδειϲοϲ in one of the documentary papyri as you are
        to see it in an ancient novel even though the novel is itself one of the most likely places to find the word. Similarly
        "gobbling up" is something that happens in fables and in comedy, but it is more common in the one than the other.
        <span class="italic">Contiones</span> are likely events among a variety of prose genres.
        "Death-bringing" is a poetic conceit, but it is especially an epic one.
    </li>
    </li>
    <li>
        You may also be shown a <span class="emph">relative frequency</span> label. This label will not be shown for 'core vocabulary' as defined below.
        <ul class="roman">
            <li>The corpora have been sliced into <span class="emph">five subdivisions</span>: top 250, top 2500, core vocabulary, rare, and very rare</li>
            <ul class="forexample">
                <li><span class="emph">Core</span> corresponds to the semi-arbitrary cut-off of >50 uses of a word.</li>
                <li><span class="emph">Rare</span> implies between 50 and 5 uses.</li>
                <li><span class="emph">Very rare</span> words are used fewer than 5 times.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>These divisions reflect the <span class="emph">logarithmic distribution</span> of word frequencies. A small number of words are
            exceptionally common. A large number of words are extremely uncommon. But the curve shape of the word distributions means that
                <span class="emph">the averages and the medians tend to be
                    severly disparate</span> within each class.</li>
            <li> Some raw data follows. These numbers will change as the parser is adjusted, but not so much as to distort the general shape of the data.
                <code>count</code> is the number of dictionary entries inside of a heading. The other numbers are the distribution of occurrences.
                If <code>low</code> is 39356, then you need at least 39356 uses to make it into that category
