<a href="https://github.com/e-gun/HipparchiaServer">HipparchiaServer</a> reads from a database. Accordingly it is implicitly the case that one could alter and/or expand this
database. This page is here to tell you that you are explicitly encouraged to improve the data.
<br />
<br />
Individual ad hoc improvements can be implemented by sending the right SQL command to the right table. You could correct a parser
entry, for example, so that the preferred accentuation of <code>ἰχθῦϲ</code> was consonant between the parser and the dictionary. Or you could
add <code>ϙόϲμοϲ</code> to the list of known forms of <code>κόϲμοϲ</code>.
<br />
<br />
Adding an author or a work is not especially difficult. One needs only to provide the answer to a set of questions about the
author (name, etc.) and the shape of the work (internal structure, etc.). And then the work itself can be inserted into a table
and, presto, it will be avialable the next time you launch HipparchiaServer.
<br />
<br />
At the moment there is no automated mechanism to do this, and even the infrastructure is sadly wanting. Nevertheless, the
technical difficulties are minimal, and anyone who wanted to contact me about a large-scale set of additions would receive
an enthusiastic reception. Alternately this can be accomplished on a DIY basis.
<br />
<br />
Imagine you wanted to add a new fragment of Sappho. She is <code>gr0009</code>. The work should probably be given a new work number
(lest a rebuild of <code>gr0009w001</code> overwrite any supplements you make). <code>gr009wZ01</code> would be perfectly adequate. Then you need
a line-by-line text of the new work that provides citation information that is associated with each line: '1, 2, 3' is probably
all you need for a fragment. The lines can have any markup you want in them: you can set bold and italic and whatnot as you like.
Naturally it would be useful to match the styles already present in <code>hipparchiastyles.css</code>, but there is no
specific requirement to do that.
<br />
<br />
Then this information would be processed by a variant of the <a href="https://github.com/e-gun/HipparchiaBuilder">HipparchiaBuilder</a> scripts that can fill out the missing columns
in a properly formatted manner.
<br />
<br />
Obviously this is just a rough overview, but the main point is to assert that there is nothing all that special that an
editor of a text would need to do in order to prepare to insert it into Hipparchia. You do not need to know Betacode, for
example. And you do not need any special kind of formatting for the citations. A few tidy spreadsheets would be more than
enough to bring to the doorstop of someone who knew python and was ready to feed your data through some scripts.
<br />
<br />
Think about it. Also think about sharing your impovements.

    NB: there is no mechanism for handling an author with an 'en' universalid or
        for 'E' as a language but it would not take very long at all to extend the
        framework so that it could accommodate all of English, German, and Russian
        literature, for example.
