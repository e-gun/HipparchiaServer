Hipparchia stores three versions of every line: a formatted version (which includes information about font display, etc.),
a version with accented words only, and a version of accentless words only.
The actual searches are executed on the words-only versions. If you type accented Greek or Latin, your search will be sensitive to accents.
If you type unaccented words, then the search is indifferent to accents.

<ul class="forexample">
    <li>formatted: <code>Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆοϲ</code></li>
    <li>accents only: <code>μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ πηληϊάδεω ἀχιλῆοϲ</code></li>
    <li>unaccented: <code>μηνιν αειδε θεα πηληιαδεω αχιληοϲ</code></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="label">Whitespace is your friend</span></p>

A search for <code>"βαλλω"</code> is not the same as a search for <code>" βαλλω"</code>. If you want only
things like βάλλων and not διαβάλλων or ἀμβαλλώμεθα or μεταβάλλωϲιν, then you should put a space in front
of your search term:<code>" βαλλω"</code>. Similarly an exact match for βάλλω and only βάλλω requires you to put a whitespace on either
side of your search term and to ask for <code>" βαλλω "</code>.

<p><span class="label">Case sensitivity</span></p>

It is important to note that <span class="emph">you cannot search for capital letters</span> vs lower-case letters.
Accordingly in an accent-aware search ἀχαιούϲ will find Ἀχαιούϲ and ἀχιλῆοϲ will find Ἀχιλῆοϲ. It is less
surprising that αχιληοϲ finds Ἀχιλῆοϲ in an unaccented search. But it is worth noting that all searches are themselves made
lower case: ΑΧΙΛΗΟΣ will also find Ἀχιλῆοϲ.

<p><span class="label">Latin vs accents</span></p>

You almost certainly want to avoid accented searches in the Latin authors unless you are willing to deal with the
<code>v</code> vs <code>u</code> problem. Every v is a u in the unaccented data. Similarly every j is an i. This means that the extremely
inconsistent practice of various editors can be unified. Only do accented searches of texts whose editorial habits you
understand. Then it will be safe to look for <code>íntro</code> and <code>hóc</code> specifically. Also keep your
regex cheat sheet handy: either <code>(v|u)</code> or <code>[uv]</code> will ignore the difference between
u and v. Similarly <code>[jiJI]</code> will allow you to find both <code>Justitia</code> and <code>iustitia</code>. There are only
3 Js in the LAT data: Juppiter manifests himself thrice in Cicero's <span class="italic">De Officiis</span>, if you must know. But
the inscriptions are fairly liberal with their deployment of <code>ejus</code> and <code>jussit</code>.

<p><span class="label">Automatic betacode</span></p>

This is enabled by default. To disable it, edit <code>config.py</code> to read <code>TLGASSUMESBETACODE = 'no'</code>.
If you are searching the Greek authors and only Greek authors, then anything you type in Roman characters will be
converted into betacode: <code>BETA</code> or <code>beta</code> becomes <code>βετα</code>, <code>udwr</code> becomes <code>υδωρ</code>
and <code>u(/dwr</code> will be <code>ὕδωρ</code>. This means you can't search for the
Latin inside of these texts unless you turn on some other corpus as well or else disable the feature. Note that this bit of magic is not available
for the other corpora because the texts inside them are bilingual. Enter unicode Greek into the search box instead.
If you don't already have a unicode keyboard, consider looking into
<a href="https://classicalstudies.org/publications-and-research/about-greekkeys-2015">GreekKeys</a>.
NB: there are lots of places where <span class="emph">betacode syntax will conflict with regex syntax</span>. It will be very hard to employ
both at once if you are going to be overly ambitious with either.

<p><span class="label">Mandatory universal betacode</span></p>
This is <span class="emph">disabled by default</span>. To enable it, edit <code>config.py</code> to read
<code>UNIVERSALASSUMESBETACODE = 'yes'</code>.
<span class="emph">This will make searching for Latin impossible</span>: <code>arma virumque</code> will become <code>αρμα ϝιρυμθυε</code>.
The syntax caveats about betacode above should also be noted. Nevertheless typing betacode can be easier in some
circumstances. For example, your keyboard might not want you to type an 'invalid' character like epsilon with
a circumflex accent over it. But the Greek inscriptions do contain <span class="emph">long epsilon</span> and
<span class="emph">long omicron</span> and their accented variants.
<code>te=s bole=s e(=i</code> or <code>TE=S BOLE=S E(=I</code> will enable you to find
<code>καὶ ἐπὶ τε͂ϲ βολε͂ϲ ἑ͂ι Κλεγένεϲ ⒣αλαιεὺϲ</code> in IG 3.375.
And UNIVERSALASSUMESBETACODE is probably the best way to search for <code>⒣αλαιεὺϲ</code> since the
<span class="emph">(undocumented) inscriptional ⒣</span> can be found by asking for <code>j</code>.
Search for <code>jalaieus</code> or <code>jalaieu\s</code>

<p><span class="label">Iota subscript and adscript</span></p>

Hipparchia distinguishes between ἀ, ᾀ, ᾶ, ᾷ, ᾳ, and so forth in the searches where accents matter. But it has no built-in way of
figuring out the difference between a subscript and an adscript. If a text prints ᾶι instead of ᾷ, a search for ᾷ
will not yield the results you wanted. You would need to search for <code>(ᾶι|ᾷ)</code> to catch both possibilities.
<br />
<br />
If you say that accents do not matter, then all iota subscripts become meaningless: ᾷ is α. This also means that
the Doric genitive singular and the Attic dative singular and the duals of many nouns will all match: τῶ and τῷ are now τω.
But how often will this be a problem for you?
<br />
<br />
If a text prints ᾶι instead of ᾷ, one has to search for αι to get a match if accents are turned off.
Hands-on work with a text you really care about will let you quickly determine what, if any, efforts you should
make to deal with this issue.
<br />
<br />
People obsessed about accents will note that Θρᾷξ appears in the corpus as Θρᾷξ, Θρᾶξ, Θρᾲξ, and Θράξ. So maybe it is ok to turn
accents off from time to time if you want to find everything that is out there. Check my work: search for
<code>\sθρ[^ᾷίὶ]ξ\s</code>

<p><span class="label">Lunate sigma</span></p>

Internally <span class="emph">all sigmas are lunate</span> unless that sigma is part of some special case.
You can type any sort of sigma you want,
but there is no way to 'find' a σ vs an ς since your query will turn into ϲ. Note that this means that any ς that
is present cannot be found. But were you really going to search for &#x03b6;&#x0337;&#x03c2;&#x0300;? Try to take
comfort in the fact that a search just for &#x03b6;&#x0337; will turn up what you were after. A capital sigma for stater
is a problem, though: you will see it (&#x03a3;), but, unlike almost all other special symbols, you can't search for it.

<p><span class="label">"Search suspended: cap reached"</span></p>

The list of items to search is not sorted. <span class="emph">Only results are sorted</span>. This means that
if you want 200 hits in chronological order, you will get 200 hits in chronological order, but, unless you experience
a bit of odd luck, you will not get
the 200 earliest possible hits (because the full search did not take place). The way the search lists are built and
dispatched means that some corpora will be searched before others and then with a higher chance of certain internal ID
numbers being checked before others. Do not try to figure out the rules of the game, either raise the cap or refine
your search instead.
