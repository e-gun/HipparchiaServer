Hipparchia stores three versions of every line: a formatted version (which includes information about font display, etc.),
a version with accented words only, and a version of accentless words only.
The actual searches are executed on the words-only versions. If you type accented Greek or Latin, your search will be sensitive to accents.
If you type unaccented words, then the search is indifferent to accents.

<ul class="forexample">
    <li>formatted: <code>Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆοϲ</code></li>
    <li>accents only: <code>μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ πηληϊάδεω ἀχιλῆοϲ</code></li>
    <li>unaccented: <code>μηνιν αειδε θεα πηληιαδεω αχιληοϲ</code></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="label">Whitespace is your friend</span></p>

A search for <code>"βαλλω"</code> is not the same as a search for <code>" βαλλω"</code>. If you want only
things like βάλλων and not διαβάλλων or ἀμβαλλώμεθα or μεταβάλλωϲιν, then you should put a space in front
of your search term:<code>" βαλλω"</code>. Similarly an exact match for βάλλω and only βάλλω requires you to put a whitespace on either
side of your search term and to ask for <code>" βαλλω "</code>.

<p><span class="label">Case sensitivity</span></p>

It is important to note that <span class="emph">you cannot search for capital letters</span> vs lower-case letters.
Accordingly in an accent-aware search ἀχαιούϲ will find Ἀχαιούϲ and ἀχιλῆοϲ will find Ἀχιλῆοϲ. It is less
surprising that αχιληοϲ finds Ἀχιλῆοϲ in an unaccented search. But it is worth noting that all searches are themselves made
lower case: ΑΧΙΛΗΟΣ will also find Ἀχιλῆοϲ.

<p><span class="label">Latin vs accents</span></p>

You almost certainly want to avoid accented searches in the Latin authors unless you are willing to deal with the
<code>v</code> vs <code>u</code> problem. Every v is a u in the unaccented data. Similarly every j is an i. This means that the extremely
inconsistent practice of various editors can be unified. Only do accented searches of texts whose editorial habits you
understand. Then it will be safe to look for <code>íntro</code> and <code>hóc</code> specifically. Also keep your
regex cheat sheet handy: either <code>(v|u)</code> or <code>[uv]</code> will ignore the difference between
u and v. Similarly <code>[jiJI]</code> will allow you to find both <code>Justitia</code> and <code>iustitia</code>. There are only
3 Js in the LAT data: Juppiter manifests himself thrice in Cicero's <span class="italic">De Officiis</span>, if you must know. But
the inscriptions are fairly liberal with their deployment of <code>ejus</code> and <code>jussit</code>.

<p><span class="label">Betacode and the automatic betacode setting</span></p>

HipparchiaServer can parse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Code">betacode</a>. But see below: the system understands
betacode, but you are not allowed to send it every possible betacode sequence.
Automatic betacode entry is <span class="emph">enabled in the default installation</span>.
To disable it, edit <code>inputsettings.py</code> to read <code>TLGASSUMESBETACODE = 'no'</code>. When this option is active,
<span class="emph">if you are searching the Greek authors and only Greek authors</span>, then anything you type in Roman characters will be
converted into betacode: <code>BETA</code> or <code>beta</code> becomes <code>βετα</code>, <code>udwr</code> becomes <code>υδωρ</code>.

If betacode transformations are active then you can't search for the
Latin inside of Greek texts unless you turn on some other corpus as well or else disable the feature. Note that this bit of magic is not available
for the other corpora because the texts inside them are bilingual. Either enable UNIVERSALASSUMESBETACODE
or enter unicode Greek into the search box instead.
If you don't already have a unicode keyboard, consider looking into
<a href="https://classicalstudies.org/publications-and-research/about-greekkeys-2015">GreekKeys</a>.
NB: there are lots of places where <span class="emph">betacode syntax will conflict with regex syntax</span>. See
examples at <span class="italic">Peculiarities and Gotchas</span> and also consult
<span class="italic">Searching: REGEX</span>.

The <span class="emph">(undocumented) inscriptional ⒣</span> can be found by asking for <code>j</code>.

A search for <code>jalaieus</code> will find <code>⒣αλαιεὺϲ</code>. But <code>jalaieu\s</code> will <span class="emph">not</span>
find <code>⒣αλαιεὺϲ</code>. The <code>\s</code> is the REGEX pattern for a whitespace character. And REGEX searching
has been given a priority over betacode support: if you need accents, use unicode.

        )   →  ᾿      )\   →  ῍
        (   →  ῾      )/   →  ῎
        /   →  ΄      )=   →  ῏
        \   →  `      h|   →  ῃ
        =   →  ῀      h(=| →  ᾗ
</pre>


Unfortunately there is no way to search for <code>ϙόϲμοϲ</code> via betacode:
<span class="emph">ϙ does not have a betacode equivalent that you are allowed to enter</span> since <code>#3</code> is
disallowed as valid user input for security reasons.

Since HipparchiaServer will not let you search for capital
letters or for anything other than a lunate sigma, betacode like <code>*D</code> or <code>S2</code> will be meaningless.
And, in fact, the asterisk in the former case will be counterproductive since that is a regex wildcard character.


<p><span class="label">Mandatory universal betacode</span></p>

This is <span class="emph">disabled in the default installation</span>. To enable it, edit <code>config.py</code> to read
<code>UNIVERSALASSUMESBETACODE = 'yes'</code>.
<span class="emph">This will make searching for Latin impossible</span>: <code>arma virumque</code> will become <code>αρμα ϝιρυμθυε</code>.
The syntax caveats about betacode above should also be noted. Nevertheless typing betacode can be easier in some
circumstances. For example, your keyboard might not want you to type an 'invalid' character like epsilon with
a circumflex accent over it. But the Greek inscriptions do contain <span class="emph">long epsilon</span> and
<span class="emph">long omicron</span> and their accented variants.
<code>te=s bole=s e(=i</code> or <code>TE=S BOLE=S E(=I</code> will enable you to find
<code>καὶ ἐπὶ τε͂ϲ βολε͂ϲ ἑ͂ι Κλεγένεϲ ⒣αλαιεὺϲ</code> in IG I<span class="superscript">3</span> 375.
And, as is implicit from the above, UNIVERSALASSUMESBETACODE is probably the best way to search for <code>⒣αλαιεὺϲ</code>.

<p><span class="label">Iota subscript and adscript</span></p>

Hipparchia distinguishes between ἀ, ᾀ, ᾶ, ᾷ, ᾳ, and so forth in the searches where accents matter. But it has no built-in way of
figuring out the difference between a subscript and an adscript. If a text prints ᾶι instead of ᾷ, a search for ᾷ
will not yield the results you wanted. You would need to search for <code>(ᾶι|ᾷ)</code> to catch both possibilities.
<br />
<br />
If you say that accents do not matter, then all iota subscripts become meaningless: ᾷ is α. This also means that
the Doric genitive singular and the Attic dative singular and the duals of many nouns will all match: τῶ and τῷ are now τω.
But how often will this be a problem for you?
<br />
<br />
If a text prints ᾶι instead of ᾷ, one has to search for αι to get a match if accents are turned off.
Hands-on work with a text you really care about will let you quickly determine what, if any, efforts you should
make to deal with this issue.
<br />
<br />
People obsessed about accents and adscripts will note that Θρᾷξ appears in the corpus as Θρᾷξ, Θρᾶξ, Θρᾲξ, and Θράξ.
So maybe it is ok to turn accents off from time to time if you want to find everything that is out there.
Check my work: search for <code>\sθρ[^ᾷίὶ]ξ\s</code>.

<p><span class="label">Lunate sigma</span></p>

Internally <span class="emph">all sigmas are lunate</span> unless that sigma is part of some special case.
You can type any sort of sigma you want, but there is no way to 'find' a σ vs an ς since your query will
turn into ϲ before it is dispatched. If you are the sort of person who wants to find internal sigmas or
terminal sigmas specifically, then see <span class="italic">Searching: REGEX</span>.
A careful study of that material will lead you to the realization that <code>ϲ[^\s]</code> and <code>ϲ\s</code> will find them.
Or ϲ + a whitespace will also find a terminal sigma. In short, your fetish is easily accommodated.
A tiny number of 'special' sigmas are present. But were you really going to search for &#x03b6;&#x0337;&#x03c2;&#x0300;?
Try to take comfort in the fact that a search just for &#x03b6;&#x0337; will turn up what you were after.
A capital sigma for stater is a problem, though: you will see it (&#x03a3;), but, unlike almost all other special symbols,
you can't search for it (and for two separate reasons). This is likely inconvenient for someone out there.
Sorry about that.
