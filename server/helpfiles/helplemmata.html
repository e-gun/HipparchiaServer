Searching by lemmata can be enabled by clicking on the box next to <code>λ</code> once <span class="emph">complex searching</span> is selected.
<br />
<br />
A box that has its <code>λ</code> checked will <span class="emph">only</span> accept a word that has been lemmatized.
<span class="emph">Lemmata are lists of known forms of a word.</span> Not every possible form is represented.
If there was no dative plural of some word found when the original data was compiled
(ages ago and not necessarily with the same data in use here and now...), then that word is not a part of the word list.
But the full set of data might indeed have that word somewhere now (or in the future).
<br />
<br />
<span class="emph">Some warnings:</span>
<ul class="forexample">
    <li>Lemmatized searches are <span class="emph">sensitive to accentuation</span>. This means if you want to search for forms of <code>φανερόϲ</code> near <code>βαϲιλεύϲ</code>
    then you will need to make sure that you either type <code>βαϲιλεὺϲ</code> (with a grave accent on the dangerous assumption that βαϲιλεὺϲ is not the last word of the sentence)
        or <code>βαϲιλε[ύὺ]ϲ</code> (allowing for either acute or grave) or <code>βαϲιλε.ϲ</code>
        (with a wildcard) since the unaccented <code>βαϲιλευϲ</code> will not be found in this sort of search.
        Conversely <code>φανεροσ</code> near <code>βαϲιλευσ</code> would yield matches,
        as would <code>φανερο[νσυ]</code> near <code>βαϲιλευϲ</code> (which would find φανερόϲ, φανερόν, φανεροῦ, and φανερούϲ).
    <li>If you defy the autocomplete suggestions and enter a form that has not been lemmatized, expect to get 0 results. Just because you know the base form of a word, this
    does not mean that that base form has been entered into the database.</li>
    <li><code>βολε͂ϲ</code> and <code>⒣όρϙοϲ</code> and <code>φϲέφιϲμα</code> will not be found if you search for
        <code>"all forms of βουλή"</code> or <code>"all forms of ὅρκοϲ"</code> or <code>"all forms of ψήφιϲμα"</code>, respectively: the lemma lists were not generated
        from the data that included these forms.</li>
    <li>Since this search is sensitive to accents, <span class="emph">enclitics</span> like <code>μοι</code> that change accentuation will
    produce misses.</li>
    <li>Some word lists are huge. Looking up 128 exact forms of a verb can be mighty slow. Lemmatized searches of common words across whole corpora will take a lot of time.</li>
</ul>
Consider double-checking anything desperately important via REGEX searches. REGEX can also find what you want more quickly if the query is properly constructed.
