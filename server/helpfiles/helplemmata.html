Searching by lemmata can be enabled by clicking on the box next to <code>λ</code> once <span class="emph">complex searching</span> is selected.
<br />
<br />
A box that has its <code>λ</code> checked will <span class="emph">only</span> accept a word that has been lemmatized.
<span class="emph">Lemmata are lists of known forms of a word.</span> Not every possible form is represented.
If there was no dative plural of some word found when the original data was compiled
(ages ago and not necessarily with the same data in use here and now...), then that word is not a part of the word list.
<br />
<br />
<span class="emph">Some warnings:</span>
<ul class="forexample">
    <li>If you defy the autocomplete suggestions and enter a dictionary form that is not known, expect to get 0 results.</li>
    <li><code>βολε͂ϲ</code> and <code>⒣όρϙοϲ</code> will not be found if you search for
        <code>"all forms of βουλή"</code> or <code>"all forms of ὅρκοϲ"</code>.</li>
    <li>Since this search is sensitive to accents, <span class="emph">enclitics</span> like <code>μοι</code> that change accentuation will
    produce misses.</li>
    <li>Some word lists are huge. 128 exact froms can be mighty slow, especially if this is a common verb.</li>
</ul>
Consider double-checking anything desperately important via REGEX searches.
