[A] issue: during the formatting call a hang:

...
    psycopg2.OperationalError: could not create socket: Too many open files

[A] working fix: modify the applescript

    ulimit -n 1024 && ~/hipparchia_venv/bin/python3 ~/hipparchia_venv/HipparchiaServer/run.py

    a bit tricky to fix for everyone and all time since this is not really about Hipparchia per se

[B] unclosed spans at ends of one result output will cause styles to propagate into the next result item

    formattedcitationincontext() needs to address this with a check of the HTML of the last line of a citation?

[C] wspolling.py remains off; delete it or make it work?
