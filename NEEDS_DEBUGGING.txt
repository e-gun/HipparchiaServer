[A] issue: during the formatting call a hang:

...
    psycopg2.OperationalError: could not create socket: Too many open files

[A] working fix: modify the applescript

    ulimit -n 1024 && ~/hipparchia_venv/bin/python3 ~/hipparchia_venv/HipparchiaServer/run.py

[B] serious performance issues with the INS and DDP databases

the huge number of tables results in serious slowdowns

refactor to store all works inside a single author seems like the solution: 3164 tables vs 196661 tables

naturally this means changing plenty of code; also what will the penalty be for old fashioned TLG and LAT searching?
