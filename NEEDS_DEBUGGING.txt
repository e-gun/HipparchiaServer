[A] latattemptelision() could use more love

MorphPossibilityObject.getlatinbaseform() needs work per-misceo
MorphPossibilityObject.getlatinbaseform() needs work permixtā, per-misceo
MorphPossibilityObject.getlatinbaseform() needs work praevortēmur, prae-verto
MorphPossibilityObject.getlatinbaseform() needs work dissīderent, dis-sido

[C] resetsession

resetsession will reload '/' without clearing date range from html (but the range has been reset)
a second click will clear the display
js async timing issue, it seems
irritating to avoid "return redirect(url_for('frontpage'))" which is so simple and easy to call

[D] platform specific bug? FreeBSD vs threads

workonsimplesearch() (and probably its kin)

a very odd bug in here on a Ryzen 1600x running FreeBSD 11.1: you can search for "mentior" 10x and
somewhere in those trials the search will fail: one of the threads will get stuck in this function
this cannot be reproduced on macOS 10.13.2 with identical versions of python and postgres installed...
this bug is not in Hipparchia? presumably it also does not affect just this function

you will not trigger the bug with the following number of workers set in config.py
    1
    2
    3
    4
at 5 and 6 you get fails: often right away
but then you can do more searches that will work for a while
then you will fail
then you can do more searches on top of this
this will leave you with two zombie threads and two eternally updating polls
