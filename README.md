HipparchiaServer typically runs from the command line within a python virtual environment

for example:

    % ~/hipparchia_venv/bin/python3 ~/hipparchia_venv/HipparchiaServer/run.py

or, more tersely:

    % run.py

Upon startup you will eventually see:

    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Then you aim your browser at http://localhost:5000 and you are ready to roll.

Alternately you can hook HipparchiaServer to something like nginx via uwsgi. That would create a different url

It would be rather unwise to expose this server to the whole internet. There are many elements to this unwisdom.

Let us only mention one of them: there are security checks inside Hipparchia, but many queries can be generated that would
consume vast computational resources. What would happen if 1000 people tried to do that to your machine at once?

Of course, most queries take <2s to execute. But servers live in the worst of all possible worlds.

Instructions on how to use Hipparchia can be found by clicking on the '?' button if you can make it to the front page.
