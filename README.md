HipparchiaServer typically runs from the command line within a python virtual environment

for example:

    % ~/hipparchia_venv/bin/python3 ~/hipparchia_venv/HipparchiaServer/run.py

or, more tersely:

    % run.py

Upon startup you will eventually see:

    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Then you aim your browser at http://localhost:5000 and you are ready to roll.

Alternately you can hook HipparchiaServer to something like nginx via uwsgi. That would create a different url

By default HipparchiaServer will not accept connections that do not originate from the host machine. It would be rather
unwise to expose this server to the whole internet. There are many elements to this unwisdom.

Let us only mention one of them: there are security checks inside Hipparchia, but many queries can be generated that would
consume vast computational resources. What would happen if 1000 people tried to do that to your machine at once?

Of course, most queries take <2s to execute. But servers live in the worst of all possible worlds.

Instructions on how to use Hipparchia can be found by clicking on the '?' button if you can make it to the front page.

```

minimum software requirements:

    to launch HipparchiaServer
        python 3.6
            pip
            flask
            psycopg2
            bs4
            websockets
        postgresql9.5

    to properly interact with HipparchiaServer via a browser
        jquery
        jquery-ui
        js-cookie
        dejavu fonts [strongly recommended, not a hard requirement]

    javascript must be enabled in the browser
    the browser must accept cookies if you wish to save searches

```
